## Welcome to UCSB Physics 5L



Physics 5L lets you experience first-hand the phenomena that necessitated the development of quantum mechanics. 

### Contact Information

######

Your Teaching Assistant (TA) is your first point of contact for this course. 
      Please reach out to them if you have questions about labs, completing your assignments, grading, regrade requests, or attendance.

:::

The Physics department's Instructional Learning Group (ILG) staff are here to help with more complex issues, servicing the equipment and working behind the scenes to ensure the labs run smoothly. 

Finally, the faculty member in charge of this course defines the course content and requirements, provides oversight and guidance to the TAs and is available to you if you have specific issues regarding DSP accomodations, find errors in the lab manual, have problems with equipment, or find yourself a witness/victim of any kind of harassment.

## Laboratory Guidelines and Policies



### Physics Department Lab Report Policies
1. To receive a passing grade, all labs must be completed.
2. To be eligible to take a make-up lab, the student must provide a written, verifiable, medical, athletic, or religious excuse. This excuse may be used for only ONE experiment per quarter and must be presented by the student to their TA prior to make-up week.
3. Careful and neat documentation is an important part of carrying out and reporting lab work and it will affect the scores on lab reports.

### Physical Laboratory Guidelines
All students attending lower division Physics Laboratory courses are reminded to observe the following rules:
1. Smoking, vaping and the use of non-medical nicotine is strictly prohibited in the lab.
2. Food and drink are not allowed in the lab.
3. Shoes must be worn when working in the lab. Avoid wearing loose fitting clothing.
4. No animals allowed in lab, except for service animals.
5. When lasers are in use, avoid looking into the light beam. The high intensity may cause permanent damage to your 
eye. Be extremely careful not to reflect the beam into anyone elseâ€™s eyes. 
6. Radioactive isotopes should be handled carefully and by the casing only.
7. If equipment is broken or circuit elements burned out, report the fact to the instructor immediately so that the 
apparatus can be properly repaired.
8. Do not remove equipment or furniture from the lab.
9. Do not alter or remove lab equipment
