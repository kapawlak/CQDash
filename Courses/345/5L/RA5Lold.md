# Gamma Radiation Absorption

The online version of this lab guide is under construction.  Please refer to [the PDF version](docs/5L%20Lab%20Guide%20-%20Gamma%20Ray%20Absorption.pdf) for now.
# Introduction
<!-- 
# History -->

# Background

# Instruments

# Procedure
:::Note
- Take notes as you work through the activities and exercises that follow.  

- It is unlikely that you will have time to complete [](#Activity-analysis) and [](#Activity-conclude) during the lab period.  
<br>

- Turn in your notes at the end of your lab period.  Then continue to take notes as you work outside of lab, *e.g.*, analyzing your data.
<br>

- Once you have finished answering all the exercises, and before your next lab period, turn in your final notes.  These should include answers to all the questions as well as any tables, plots, drawings, screenshots, etc. that you produced.
<br>
<br>
- Remember to specify all quantities with (i) appropriate units, if any, and (ii) the correct number of significant figures.

## Prepare the Instruments

## Observe the ______

## Make the Measurements
:::::::::Activity (analysis|Analyze Data)

::::::Exercise (analyze V_s|2 points per method described, 2 points per $V_s$ determined, 4 points for a well-formatted table)
::::::



:::::::::

::::::Activity (conclude|Draw Conclusions)
Refer to the fit parameters you obtained in [](#Activity-analysis) 
:::Exercise (values|2 points per bullet)
<!-- - What is Planck's constant, $h$?

- What is work function of the CsSb alloy, $\phi$?

- What data contributed to these values?

- What value did you use for $e$? -->
:::

The currently accepted value of <!-- Planck's constant is $h=(6.62606957 \pm 0.00000029)\times 10^{-34}~\mathrm{J s}$. -->

:::Exercise (discrepancy| 4 points)
- How large a fraction of the accepted value is the discrepancy between your measurement and the accepted value?

- Calculate this proportionate discrepancy by taking the difference and dividing it by the accepted value:
<!-- $$
\frac{|h_\mathrm{measured}-h_\mathrm{accepted}|}{h_\mathrm{accepted}}.
$$ -->

- Give your answer as a percentage.

# Conclusion

:::Exercise (summarize|10 Points)
Write a brief conclusion summarizing the important points of this lab.
:::

:::Summary

You are expected to turn in all plots and tables you are asked to make in the exercises, as well as all answers to questions
