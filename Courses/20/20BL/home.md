## Welcome to UCSB Physics 20BL

Physics 20BL is the second course in a three-course sequence that gives students a first-hand introduction to Experimental Physics. The exercises draw on content from introductory physics courses, but the purpose of the course is not to reinforce or reteach the lecture material, nor is it to demonstrate phenomena. The purpose of this course is to equip you with the skills and mindset of an experimentalist, to give you experience making and rigorously evaluating measurements, and to give you a taste of how physical principles are deduced from observations and experimentation.

<!-- We will cover topics such as uncertainty, uncertainty estimation, linear fitting, oscilloscope use, and more.  -->

## Laboratory Safety



<!-- ### Physics Department Lab Report Policies.
1. Careful and neat documentation is an important part of carrying out and reporting lab work and it will affect the scores on lab reports. -->

<!-- ### Physical Laboratory Guidelines -->
All students engaged in Physics Department Laboratory courses are expected to observe the following rules:
1. Smoking, vaping or non-medical nicotine use are not allowed in the lab.
2. Food and drink are not allowed in the lab.
3. Shoes must be worn when working in the lab. Avoid wearing loose fitting clothing.
4. No animals are allowed in the lab, except for service animals.
5. Pay special attention when lasers are in use, avoid looking into the light beam. The high intensity may cause permanent damage to your eyes. Be extremely careful not to reflect the beam into anyone elseâ€™s eyes. 
6. Radioactive isotopes should be handled carefully and by the casing only.
7. Promptly report any breakage or failure of equipment to the instructor.
8. Do not alter or remove lab equipment or lab furniture.
